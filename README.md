## Explanation of My Work

- I started out just tackling the HTML and CSS to get that looking good. I used a mix of Bootstrap and vanilla CSS tools like Flexbox to get the final layout to show I can work with both. I also implemented Sass to show I have experience using it.

- I then looked into the validation/JS part of the form submission. Knowing you use Vue.js at CHG I implemented the validation using that. It was a fun experience. My experience with frameworks has been mostly with React and a little bit with Angular. I really liked using Vue. It was a good developer experience and it was relatively easy to get the validation implemented.

- There were a few typos in the README so I fixed those. I'm only pointing this out because it said to have the modal say "Thanks you." I wasn't sure if that was a test to see if I read the instructions carefully or not, but I changed it to "Thank you" and that is how I implemented the modal. I hope that was okay. :smiley:

- Overall it took 2.5 hours to get it finished, and then I took about 10-15 minutes the next day to review it before submitting it.
